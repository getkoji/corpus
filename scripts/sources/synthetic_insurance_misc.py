"""Synthetic insurance document generator — binders, demand letters, claim forms.

Generates three document types for the Koji validation corpus:

  - Insurance Binders (30 docs) → insurance_policies/
  - Subrogation Demand Letters (30 docs) → insurance_claims/
  - Filled-In Claim Forms (50 docs: 30 WC FROI + 20 property proof of loss) → insurance_claims/

Uses a fixed random seed (20260416) for reproducibility.
